# Watch-Analysis-
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of luxury watch features, brand trends, and pricing behaviour. It visualizes key attributes like movement, case specs and complications while integrating machine learning predictions to estimate watch prices and uncover factors driving premium valuation.

✨ Project Overview

Luxury watches often command premium prices driven by brand prestige, craftsmanship, material quality and engineering features.
This project:

✔ cleans & prepares raw watch data
✔ visualizes feature trends and brand patterns
✔ builds ML models to predict price
✔ identifies key attributes affecting value

A Power BI dashboard complements the analysis, offering interactive exploration and business-ready insights.

📂 Files Included

Dashboard.pbix / .pbit — Interactive watch insights dashboard

Notebook / Python script — Data processing + ML modelling

Dataset — Luxury watch data with design attributes

🔧 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)

Power BI for visualization

Jupyter / IDE for scripting

🧹 Data Processing

✔ Handling encoding issues
✔ Cleaning mixed text values (e.g., “48 hours”)
✔ Converting categorical features
✔ Missing value imputation
✔ Feature engineering (movement scoring, size factors etc.)

🤖 Machine Learning

Multiple models were tested — Linear Regression, RandomForest and XGBoost.
XGBoost achieved the best performance with an R² ≈ 0.61, making it suitable for predictive deployment.
